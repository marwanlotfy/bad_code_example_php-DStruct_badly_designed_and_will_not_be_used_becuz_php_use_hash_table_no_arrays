# php-datastruct

Now We Have refcatored this code to a more Bad Version where we use Startegy Pattern And Make the logic of storing data is encapsulated inside Each Startegy and Make It reusable when we implenets The Queue 
I hope you was Watching me while Writing The Code inside Queue Class It was very Easy and take 2 minute to write it 

and i also write bug but when i solve it 

it was solved at stack and queue 

thats the power when you D.R.Y your code as much as possible make it easy for you to develop and extend features and solve bugs 

but this code is still useless because i will refactor this code to be written in C++ 

because you can hand on low level stuff with object oriented programming syntax flavour in C++ 

and i want to tell you something programming language is just a tool u used to solve the problem

the whole thing in software development is about the logic that make your task go green 

thats why i strat this code example in php to show you when the programming language arises to say hey you need to use me because i have the features that will can implement your logic Fast

and thats what we really need 

when you do programming in short time 

it means less bugs and the code can be read if its writen badly

and thats what will make you good developer when you do the task before any other of your candidate 

if you stay with me  I want To Give You a Big THAAAAAAAAAAAAnks
